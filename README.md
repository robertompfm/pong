# pong
A version of the classic Pong game developed with pygame library

This game was proposed as one of the projects from Rice University's Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, on Coursera. At the course, the project originally was developed on python2 and using codeskulptor and simpleGUI. But here I adapted it using python3 and pygame, I also tried to use Obeject Oriented Programming.

About the game:
There are two paddles that you can control using the keyboard.
Use 'UP' and 'DOWN' arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down.
Use 'W' and 'S' keys to move the left paddle up and down.
If the ball crosses the blue line a goal is scored and the ball will respawn at the center of the board.
